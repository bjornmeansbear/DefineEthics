> There are professions more harmful than industrial design, but only very few of them.  
Victor Papaenk, _Design for the Real World_, 1971

## Ethics.

## Design Ethics?

Design ethcis are meant to help us collectively understand what we should expect from each other and how we should use deisgn out in the world.

We can spin “Do No Harm” into a pretty good criteria for ethically designing.

Focus on doing no harm to the public; then worry about the client; then worry about one's ego; and make sure you don't let down design/your fellow designers... ?

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Designers should be valued for the ideas embodied in their designs …

Design ethics aren't about professional duties (???) -- the voice of design / the way a design "speaks"

design should express desire, needs, aspirations.

Design Tensions:
1. To One's Self & One's Colleagues
2. To The Client
3. To The Public
4. To The Environment/World/Universe
5. To The Art of Design itself

(Where do printers, paper makers, etc. fit into this? Colleagues?)

Design should ILLUMINATE problems (not just solve them...) ??? Transcend traditional definition of duty???

intentional solution within a given set of constraints

there aren't edge cases; just people

But there are cases where you are designing something for a regime you disagree with, or to be misused as symbols for things that don't really exist! (freedom, democracy?)

Is Graphic Design a moral issue? Human situations are moral issues -- and Graphic Design/Communication Design helps mediate human situations; so isn't it then yes, a moral issue?

Practice two things in your designing: either help or do no harm to cultures, societies, and most importantly our planet. (A Hippocratic path for designing???)
