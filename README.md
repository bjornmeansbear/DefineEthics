## Ethics.

General Definitions:

### [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethic)

- the discipline dealing with what is good and bad and with moral duty and obligation
- a set of moral principles : a theory or system of moral values 
- the principles of conduct governing an individual or a group 
- a guiding philosophy

Ethics and morals are both used in the plural and are often regarded as synonyms, but there is some distinction in how they are used. Morals often describes one's particular values concerning what is right and what is wrong. While ethics can refer broadly to moral principles, one often sees it applied to questions of correct behavior within a relatively narrow area of activity. Morals usually connotes an element of subjective preference, while ethics tends to suggest aspects of universal fairness and the question of whether or not an action is responsible

### [Business Dictionary](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/ethics.html)

**Ethics/Personal Ethics:** The basic concepts and fundamental principles of decent human conduct. It includes study of universal values such as the essential equality of all men and women, human or natural rights, obedience to the law of land, concern for health and safety and, increasingly, also for the natural environment. / The basic principles and values that govern interactions among individuals. Sound personal ethics are typically those that positively impact the experience of others when used to govern an individual's social or business related behavior, and at the very least, such ethics should not have a negative impact on others.

**Morality:** Conformance to a recognized code, doctrine, or system of rules of what is right or wrong and to behave accordingly. No system of morality is accepted as universal, and the answers to the question "What is morality?" differ sharply from place to place, group to group, and time to time. For some it means conscious and deliberate effort in guiding one's conduct by reason based on fairness and religious beliefs. For others it is, in the words of the UK mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947), "... what the majority then and there happen to like, and immorality is what they dislike."

### [Cambridge Dictionary]()
- a system of accepted beliefs that control behaviour, especially such a system based on morals
- Social responsiblity

### [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics)
- relating to one's character
- a set of concepts and principles that guide us in determining what behavior helps or harms sentient creatures
- moral principles of a particular tradition, group or individual
- think critically about moral values and direct our actions in terms of such values
- standards for the rightness and wrongness of actions (Normative Ethics)

### [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/introduction/intro_1.shtml)
Moral somewhere-in-between-ism: Most non-philosophers think that both of the above theories have some good points and think that
- there are a few absolute ethical rules
- but a lot of ethical rules depend on the culture

### [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/)

#### From https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-environmental/
- the rightness or wrongness of actions is determined by reference to the consequences of those actions—a familiar consequentialist ethical principle. However, for Leopold, the relevant consequences are the “integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community”
- defend a notion of the self as a relational, ecological being who is a member of the larger biotic (living, organic, ecological) community.
#### From https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-business/#CorpMoraAgen
- One way to think about business ethics is in terms of the moral obligations of agents engaged in business activity. Who is a moral agent? Individual persons, obviously. What about firms? This question is typically described as a question of “corporate moral agency” or “corporate moral responsibility”. Here ‘corporate’ does not refer to the corporation as a legal entity, but to a collective or group of individuals. To be precise, the question is whether firms are moral agents and morally responsible considered as (qua) firms, not considered as aggregates of individual members of firms.
- firms are morally responsible for what they do, and hence should be seen as “full-fledged” moral persons.
- perfect information: minimally, consumers have to understand the features of the products for sale.

## Design Ethics?

What are your intentions when you design something?

Design ethics are meant to help us collectively understand what we should expect from each other and how we should use deisgn out in the world.

We can spin “Do No Harm” into a pretty good criteria for ethically designing.

Focus on doing no harm to the public; then worry about the client; then worry about one's ego; and make sure you don't let down design/your fellow designers... ?

How should ethical (moral?) principles guide design operations (deisgn solutions? design processes? design projects? designed outcomes?)

clearly lay out the rules for behavior

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I am responsible for my choice of client and for the content I endorse. (http://www.starvingforethics.com/)

Designers should be valued for the ideas embodied in their designs …

Design ethics aren't about professional duties (???) -- the voice of design / the way a design "speaks"

design should express desire, needs, aspirations.

Design Tensions:
1. To One's Self & One's Colleagues
2. To The Client
3. To The Public
4. To The World (the more than human)
5. To The Art of Design itself

(Where do printers, paper makers, etc. fit into this? Colleagues?)

Design should ILLUMINATE problems (not just solve them...) ??? Transcend traditional definition of duty???

intentional solution within a given set of constraints

there aren't edge cases; just people

But there are cases where you are designing something for a regime you disagree with, or to be misused as symbols for things that don't really exist! (freedom, democracy?)

Is Graphic Design a moral issue? Human situations are moral issues -- and Graphic Design/Communication Design helps mediate human situations; so isn't it then yes, a moral issue?

Practice two things in your designing: either help or do no harm to cultures, societies, and most importantly our planet. (A Hippocratic path for designing???)

deep ecology/shallow ecology?

abandon the “culture versus nature” dualism

humans are just one strand in a greater biotic web

It's time. This is our last chance to do anything about the global climate and ecological emergency. Our last chance to save the world as we know it. 

A note about terminology is relevant here. Many ecofeminist philosophers distinguish between the oppression of women and the (unjustified) domination of nature. (from https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-environmental/)

Sexism, racism, classism, heterosexism, and ethnocentrism are examples of unjustified “-isms of domination” (from: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-environmental/)

first things first: Garland’s manifesto highlights the trivial nature of using graphic design skill purely for advertising. 

first things first 2000: The profession’s time and energy is used up manufacturing demand for things that are inessential at best.

we must judge the value of our design work by the impact it has on the world, good or bad — and it’s up to you to be aware of that impact. (Mike Monteiro)

review and reflect on the impact your designs have on the world, and decide where your own boundaries lie. (https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/ethics/)

Empathy, put simply, is an ability to understand the world through other people’s eyes—and put aside our own biases as we do so. (https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/ethics/)

no matter what technology or design you look at, even something we consider as well-intended and as good in its effects as Stutzman's Freedom, comes with certain values embedded in it. (https://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_deterding_what_your_designs_say_about_you/transcript#t-57513)

What values do you use to judge? (https://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_deterding_what_your_designs_say_about_you/transcript#t-338264)

For Aristotle, Ethics was about the question of how to live life well. (https://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_deterding_what_your_designs_say_about_you/transcript#t-398146)

Does a design create a vision or aspiration for the good life they present? can design create aspirational "goodness" in a user/reader/viewer/etc.

"What is the vision of the good life that our products, our design, present to us?" (https://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_deterding_what_your_designs_say_about_you/transcript#t-445026)

No matter whether we as designers intend it or not, we materialize morality. We make certain things harder and easier to do. We organize the existence of people. We put a certain vision of what good or bad or normal or usual is in front of people, by everything we put out there in the world. / Peter-Paul Verbeek / https://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_deterding_what_your_designs_say_about_you/transcript#t-514141

the design of any product can be a moral dilemma: designers must balance their own economic survival, the financial interest of the client and the well-being of the user. (https://www.ethicsfordesign.com/about)

Ethics is a permanent questioning of what is desirable for the good of all and it is unthinkable that designers do not take their part in this questioning. (https://www.ethicsfordesign.com/about)

Ethics in graphic design remains a predominantly subjective area, rigid rules do not define the appropriate use (or mis-use) of talent. The moral framework is left to the designer’s conscience, often overruled by issues such as finance or career progression. (https://ethicsofdesign.wordpress.com/)

graphic designers and their employers fail to understand the importance and consequence of their actions. (https://ethicsofdesign.wordpress.com/)

Moral ethics to be studied are:
- Manipulation
- Corruption
- Dishonesty
- Misrepresentation
- Exploitation

The ethical issues to be addressed often feed into larger issues affecting society. Examples of these include:
- Human rights
- Health
- Discrimination
- Crime
- Politics
- Poverty

from the [ethics of design website](https://ethicsofdesign.wordpress.com/background/moral-ethics/):
> Moral ethics refers to behaviour and/or conduct which is considered to be right and/or good in relation to the rules of conduct outlined through design education, discussion, set by precedent and moral intuition.

> Designer’s ethical conversations should include a deep self-reflective process related to the decisions they are making, who they are designing for, why, and the social and environmental impact behind the artifacts they are creating.
